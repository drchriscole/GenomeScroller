      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <h2>Dr Nick Schurch</h2>
      <p>Nick was educated and worked as an astrophysicist before joining the world of 
      Bioinformatics, at Dundee, in 2009. His research focuses on identifying the genes 
      involved in interesting biological processes, like the very first steps in an 
      embryo's development. Throughout this work he has been fascinated and surprised 
      by the complexity of the Human genome and how much there is still to discover.</p>
      
      <h2>Dr Chris Cole</h2>
      <p>Originally a Chemistry graduate, Chris first became interested in Bioinformatics 
      when all his lab experiments failed to work during his PhD. Since then he has found 
      a fascinating world of protein structure and complex biological problems. He moved 
      to Dundee in 2006 and has continued his research in Bioinformatics as part of the 
      <a href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/dag.html">Data Analysis Group</a>. </p>
      
      <h2>Peter Richardson</h2>
      <p>Peter, formerly the Director of the Visual Effects Research Lab funded by the E.U. 
      based at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art &amp; Design, University of Dundee, is
      now at the <a href="http://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/peter-richardson(aab16688-6c31-486b-b4db-534e07287303).html">University of Hertfordshire</a>. 
      He contributed to version 1 of <span class='genome'>genome</span><span class='scroller'>scroller</span>.</p>
      
      <h2>Professor Geoff Barton</h2>
      <p>Geoff is professor of Bioinformatics and Head of the <a href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/dag.html">Data Analysis Group</a> in 
      Dundee.  He has worked for over 25 years on developing computational methods to 
      understand the structure and function of biological molecules such as DNA and 
      proteins.  Scientists world-wide use computer programs and techniques developed by 
      his group in their diverse research.  <span class='genome'>genome</span><span class='scroller'>scroller</span> shows how massive the human 
      genome is, but we now have tens of Human genomes and will soon know thousands!  This 
      is a very exciting time for Bioinformatics research as we work out new ways to 
      analyse and understand this wealth of information!</p>
      
      <p>We would like to acknowledge the help of Dr Richard Bickerton without whose PyMol 
      skills we would have struggled to get such good protein structure animations.</p>
